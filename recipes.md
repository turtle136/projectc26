pbj sandwich recipe = get the spoon of jelly and get the jelly on the top side of one of the breads and gently and graciousfully spread the jelly on the piece of maginificient bread with care using the spoon. You're then gonna repeat the same process but instead of using another jelly spoon you are be going to using the peanut butter spoon and the other piece of bread, and once you have finished you are going to get the bread that has jelly on it and the bread that has peanut butter on it and make sure the two top sides are facing each other and then you are going to collide the two very carefully with honor and now you are going to place the sandwhich on its belly on a very clean plate, and bam you have got a marvalous pbj sandwich that is ready to eat.
